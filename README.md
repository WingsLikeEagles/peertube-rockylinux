# peertube-rockylinux
Terraform plan to install Peertube on a Rocky Linux 8.4 instance in AWS Cloud  

You'll obviously need an AWS account for this.  This should work in the Free Tier.  
You also need to create a Key for connecting to the instance using ssh named "peertube" or change the name in the TF file.
